# Assemport
Assembly-Export for IDA 9.0 Pro. **Assemport** exports all functions separately in an assembly file. This enables further processing by external tools such as an AI.

## Installation
Just download the `ZIP` file and unpack it to your `IDA 9.0` installations folder.

> [!NOTE]
> The default installation folder of plugins is `C:\Program Files\IDA Professional 9.0\plugins`

## Usage
Open your `IDA`-Project and type the `F12`-Key.

All assemblys will be stored in the current inspected executable folder under `/Assemport/`.
